#Lessons

List of ideas:
1. Basic HTML and CSS
	Make this a lot like what Martin taught us. The basics were great. Begin with the layout/formatting stuff maybe? 
2. Github/How to develop
	Piggy back off of Github tutorial. Think about getting gitbash. Run most of the stuff through terminal/gitbash/cmd line. You could give them the choice of what to use, but it would also be a bit harder to follow along. <strong>Only use gitbash.</strong>
