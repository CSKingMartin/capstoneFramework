<h2>Ideas</h2>
<h3>1. Basic HTML and CSS:</h3>

Make this a lot like what Martin taught us. The basics were great. Begin with the layout/formatting stuff maybe? How are they going to get the repo? They will need to have gibash etc. installed BEFORE they can get access to sinfulCat. 
	
<strong>Process in class:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> Ideally we need these things installed: node.js, gitbash, sublimetext3.</li>
	<li> Process to clone the sinfulCat repo needs to be outlined and easy.</li>
	<li> Setup of directory organization needs to be enforced:</li>
		<pre>z:/COMPXXX/sinfulCat/modules/..</pre>
	<li> Test Gulp/gulpfile.js </li>
	<li> Get into the HTML/CSS stuff -- make sure Gulp is up and running for easy access to changes. </li>
	</ol>

<h3>2. Github/How to develop</h3>
Piggy back off of Github tutorial. Think about getting gitbash. Run most of the stuff through terminal/gitbash/<s>cmd line</s>. <s>You could give them the choice of what to use, but it would also be a bit harder to follow along.</s> <strong>Only use gitbash.</strong> Start by setting up the repo @ Github.com -- then practice pushing to the repo. Create a dev branch to mess with, teach how pushing to 'master' is for saving builds. 

How is this going to look? How are they going to maintain different builds/different gulpfiles while pushing to the same repo?
