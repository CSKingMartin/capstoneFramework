#Lesson 1 -- Getting Set Up and Experimenting

<h3>Welcome to COMPxxx</h3>

This course is all designed to help teach skills for Front End web development, or FED. There are more pieces to Web Development then just the front end, but oftentimes in order to have a small personal site, there isn't a large need for the back end parts. 

There are generally two parts to a development stack. The front end, which builds the front-facing markup. This is also referred to as client-side development, or the presentation layer. The back end deals with the server-side elements, like how the database talks to the web application and server. 

The key tools we'll be learning to use for Front End Development are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You don't need to have had any previous programming experience to learn these tools. Lots of the language is simply putting containers around what content you want to share, and then writing rules to control where those containers go and how they look. 

<h3>Foward</h3>

Before we get too far, take a look at the following link:

Talk about the inherit operation of web development. Talk about 'masterbation.' Reference Evan.

<h3>Needed Downloads</h3>

In order to make the learning process easier, we are going to use a preconfigured framework that will help us experiment with writing basic HTML and CSS, and will then move us towards writing good HTML and CSS.

***Need the actual process, won't be in place until framework is finished.***

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

(After sinfulCat is downloaded)

There are quite a few files you'll see in your directory here. The 'modules' folder contains all of the lesson plans, so if you ever miss a session or want to work ahead you can look there for the course content. The .gitignore and package.json files you probably won't touch, they're configuration files for Github and for the NPM modules. 

The 'src' folder is what we'll primarily be working in. 'src' stands for 'source,' and it's pretty common for most Web Development projects to have one. All of the folders in here contain our organized, original markup. Oftentimes there will be some pre-processing of files that can condense the data, execute some logic, or other things that the browser can't do. All of the final markup that the browser can read will usually be in a 'dist' folder, which stands for distribution. 

As you can see in our 'src' folder, there's already some files in there. Go ahead and open up the 'index.html' file with your browser.

It's nothing special, but all the content of webpages come from '.html' files paired with '.css' and '.js' files to organize content for the viewing pleasure of many.

Like all code, all of the documents come down to beng just text. Thankfully we have better tools than Microsoft Word for writing code. Open up Sublime Text -- then under 'File' select 'Open Folder.' Find in your directory wherever you put the 'sinfulCat' repo and open that folder.

On the left, you can now see all of our files just like we can in Windows Explorer or Finder. 

Go ahead and take a look at the content of the 'index.html' file we just opened.
Let's make a small change to this document; add some text somewhere and then either reopen it or refresh the page on the browser. 

Voila! Easy-peasy.
