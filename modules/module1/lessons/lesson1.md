#Lesson 1 -- Getting Set Up and Experimenting

<h3>Welcome to COMPxxx</h3>

This course is all designed to help teach skills for Front End web development, or FED. There are more pieces to Web Development then just the front end, but oftentimes in order to have a small personal site, there isn't a large need for the back end parts. 

There are generally two parts to a development stack. The front end, which builds the front-facing markup. This is also referred to as client-side development, or the presentation layer. The back end deals with the server-side elements, like how the database talks to the web application and server. 

The key tools we'll be learning to use for Front End Development are HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You don't need to have had any previous programming experience to learn these tools. Lots of the language is simply putting containers around what content you want to share, and then writing rules to control where those containers go and how they look. 

<h3>Needed Downloads</h3>

In order to make the learning process easier, we are going to use a preconfigured framework that will help us experiment with writing basic HTML and CSS, and will then move us towards writing good HTML and CSS.

***Need the actual process, won't be in place until framework is finished.***
