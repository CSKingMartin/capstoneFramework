#Sections:
<ul>
  <li>
    <h3>Module 1: Basic HTML/CSS</h3>
    Learn layout practices, basic formatting for beginning HTML/CSS. Build a few things, mess with a few others. Good place to have the Resume project, as well as possible the Linfield Images.
  </li>

    <h3>Module 2: Launching a Site</h3>
    Building a homepage to host other project work. Make this more a part of the project, be pretty specific with what's to be included on it content wise (as far as putting all of the student's work at one place). Grading would be easy -- look on their website and see the content. Here, we learn the launch workflow -- src to dist to gh-pages(or asteroid). Creating multiple branches to keep changes we want. In class work (for that day) would be pushed to the 'master' branch. Encourage use of 'dev' branch for work, and then merge to master.

    <h3>Module 3: Templating Languages</h3>
    Reusable code written in templates. Translating pieces already written (navbar, sidebar, content, etc.) and moving them outside to templating units. This should be a large, timely section -- thinking about letting students choose their own fate by giving them a selection of templating languages and letting them choose. This will be frustrating, and time consuming -- requires Instructor to know all the templating languages to a certain extent. Key goals include: making the navbar accessable/uniform across many pages on a static site; creating custom stylized buttons, cards, or sidebars; and creating a div class that will be used to showcase work/simulate a browser window -- this would also allow for a "fullscreen" (full browser)? access. 
  </li>

    <h3>Module 4: SASS/SCSS</h3>
      Reusable, extractable CSS. This should be quick and easy in comparison to the Templating Languages -- the order of these two modules are debatable. Whether we want the course to move at a steady pace, or have spikes of difficulty should be reserved for perhaps a post-class survey, or a before class survey. We can move towards having modules be contained in files with their own html, css, and javascript(?) included in one place. Good test of ease/modularization: having classmates look and use each other's framework/stuff to develop.
