#Lessons for Module 2

<h2>Ideas</h2>
<h3>Basic Page Elements:</h3>

Moving from basic little side projects to working toward building a functoinal webpage hub. Work on building pieces that are common across lots of sites -- i.e navbar, sidebar, content? Should walk through creating an 'index.html'. 

<h3>Deployment</h3>
	
This is also the section where we'll need to establish a workflow for updating/pushing to a deployment site. There are several... which to use? It might serve the purpose of this class to look at SSGs and pick one of those which would still serve as a good vehicle for our goals. On the other hand, gh-pages as well as Asteroid are both easily accessable, and are very SIMPLE. Simplicity fits with our core goals of contained learning -- that is no 'magic.'

What my workflow looks like for my current Website Project is keeping a separate .git repo in my 'dist' folder, which pushes to the 'gh-pages' remote (github's way of doing their own thing). This is very good. Asteroid testing will have to wait until I'm on Campus/have a refresher of how that works. If I remember right, we SSH-ed onto the server and put our files up from there. This is perhaps AS cumbersome as clunky gh-pages pushing. I don't know if the SSH could be automated. Perhaps install a new remote there? Where we could push the 'dist' folder? IDK -> maybe Martin has more preference.
