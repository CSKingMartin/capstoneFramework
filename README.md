# frameworkProject
My initial project at ConnectiveDX, building a personal custom web-framework.


#What I'm using:
I was pretty much given an open sandbox to create whatever I wanted, proviced that it was working towards building a web development
framework that would come close to emulating some of the functions of ConnectiveDX's existing Phoenix framework:
<br>
https://github.com/connectivedx/Phoenix
<br>
As such I've decided to use:
  <ul>
    <li>Nunjucks as a Partial Language</li>
    <li>SASS for my CSS</li>
    <li>Gulp as the build package to compile everything</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
I'm still pretty new to the field, so my terminology might be a little off, but those are the gist of my goals.
